##My Leadership README 

#Philosophy

I believe in servant leadership which means listening before speaking. 
I like to fix things as they come up and make small improvements over time. I don’t get in the way and will find areas where I can add value and not step on your toes. I believe that all projects & processes sit inside an infinite continuum that is always changing. I welcome and embrace change. Change is the only constant in software development. My role in this continuum is to make sure that we get the right things done. 

#Expectations for Folks Who Report to Me

Accessing Me
I am accessible all of the time. The best way to get in touch with me is to come up and interrupt me at my desk. No issue is too small. If I’m not at my desk then message me through Slack or E-Mail. This allows me to take time to understand what is going on and respond back in a timely manner. If I get messages during non-work hours, I will still check, but may give a delayed response. I always respond, however.

If something is urgent off-hours, I prefer getting a text message on my personal phone or a phone call. Again, I will respond. My job is to not block you and make sure the team and our systems are healthy.

My calendar is always up to date. If you want to meet, find time and book it. I am here for you. I like being prepared for meetings, so having an Agenda published is helpful. If you need me to review anything, please send in advance so I can come to the meeting with good questions and feedback.

#Management Style

I think highly of the Directly Responsible Individual model. The peers I work with are smart, and more often than not, smarter than me. If you are assigned a part of a project or a task, you own it. I won’t tell you how to do it. If you get stuck, need a second pair of eyes etc. you can ask me for help. I will do what it takes to assess the situation and get it unblocked. I prefer that you bring things up as early as possible so we can minimize any impacts. 

I am also very curious and a tech nerd at heart. I will ask questions about what you’re doing, how you implemented something, and why you chose a certain path. This isn’t to probe or second guess you. It’s so that I can learn along side with you. Ultimately, it is your job to ship what you’re working on. If you don’t ship, I will ask why and understand where things broke down. We are in this together. We will fix it together. Software can change.

When working on projects together, I err on the side of over-communication. This means writing everything down. Meeting minutes, Story criteria, whiteboard notes etc. If what is in your head isn’t captured somewhere, it doesn’t do anyone any good. Writing is thinking, so I expect documentation as a form of clear thought.

#Communication & Feedback

I like radical candor. If I am doing something wrong, or you don’t agree, then tell me. I am wrong a lot. As long as we ultimately do the right thing, I believe it is ok to be wrong. Criticism and feedback are important, so as you help me improve, I will also nudge you if I see something is off. This isn’t intended to be malicious. This is so we can constantly fix things and be honest with ourselves. I care about you, and I hope that you care about me. We give criticisms and praise to those that we care about.

I value 1:1’s and believe that it is your time to bring up anything. I don’t want to get into status updates or project reports, we have plenty of meetings for those. I would much rather hear about what is concerning you, what you are happy with, and anything that is on your mind. We build relationships here. My goal is to make sure you’re happy and you get what you want out of working here. 

 
#Nuances & Errata

I am an introvert. I am very good in small group settings and tend to fade in larger environments. I also prefer Slack and IM as the first form of communication as it can handle 80% of most conversations. 

When I ask you to do something that isn’t clear or poorly defined I am likely still brainstorming. Ask for more. Push me. I love structure, so I will gladly break it down for you.

I am data driven. I would much rather discuss and think through facts vs. opinions. If you show me data, and it is in your favor, you win. If we are debating without data, I will most likely disengage until we have something of substance.

I’ve been told I look serious at times. I’m not mad or concerned. So don’t worry :). If I am one of the above, I will tell you as part of radical candor.
